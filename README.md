# imdbinfo

**Your personal gateway to IMDb data**. Search for movies, series and people and get structured information in seconds.

## 💣 New in v0.5.0 

### **Localized results** in multiple languages (set globally or per request)

Added support for locales in `search_movie`, `get_movie`, `get_episodes`, `get_all_episodes`, `get_name`
```python
from imdbinfo import get_movie, search_title
# Fetch movie details in Italian
movie_it = get_movie("tt0133093", locale="it")  # The Matrix

# Search for titles in Spanish (although IMDb search is mostly in all languages)
results_es = search_title("La Casa de Papel", locale="es")
```

Localized data can be set globally, dont need to pass `locale` every time in the functions:
```python
from imdbinfo import get_movie
from imdbinfo.locale import set_locale
set_locale("it")  # Set default locale to Italian
movie_it = get_movie("tt0133093")  # The Matrix in Italian
```

## Installation

## Quick Start

```python
from imdbinfo import search_title, get_movie, get_name, get_season_episodes

# Search for a title
results = search_title("The Matrix")
for movie in results.titles:
    print(f"{movie.title} ({movie.year}) - {movie.imdb_id}")

# Get movie details
movie = get_movie("0133093")  # or 'tt0133093'
print(movie.title, movie.year, movie.rating)

# Get movie kind:
print(movie.kind)  # movie, tvSeries, tvMiniSeries, tvMovie, tvEpisode, tvSpecial, tvShort, short, videoGame, video, musicVideo, podcastEpisode, podcastSeries
print(movie.is_series())  # False

# Get person details
person = get_name("nm0000206")  # or '0000206' 
print(person.name, person.birth_date)
```
#### Working with Series and Episodes

The `movie` object provides helpful methods to identify its type:

- `movie.is_series()` — Returns `True` if the movie is a series.
- `movie.is_episode()` — Returns `True` if the movie is an episode.

Depending on the type, you can access additional information:

- For series: use `movie.info_series` to get series details.
- For episodes: use `movie.info_episode` to get episode details.

#### Example: Working with Series and Episodes

```python
from imdbinfo import get_movie, get_season_episodes

# Fetch a TV series as a Movie object
walking_dead_serie = get_movie("tt1520211")  # Walking Dead

# Check if the object is a series
print(walking_dead_serie.is_series())  # True

# Access series-specific information
print(f"Series Info: {walking_dead_serie.info_series}")

# Retrieve episodes for the series season 1
walking_dead_episodes = get_season_episodes(walking_dead_serie.imdb_id, season=1)

# Print details for the first 3 episodes from the season 1
for episode_info in walking_dead_episodes[:3]:
    print(episode_info)

# Fetch a single episode as a Movie object and check its type
episode_detail = get_movie(episode_info.imdb_id)
print("Is Episode:", episode_detail.is_episode())  # True

# Access episode-specific information: series imdbid, season and episode number ...
print(f"Episode Info: {episode_detail.info_episode}")
```

#### All episodes in a series
You can now retrieve all episodes in a series with a single call:
```python
from imdbinfo import get_all_episodes
# Fetch all episodes for a series
all_episodes = get_all_episodes("tt1520211")  # Walking Dead
for episode in all_episodes:
    print(f"Title: {episode.title} - ({episode.imdbId})")
    print(f"Plot: {episode.plot[:100]}...")
    print(f"Release Date: {episode.release_date}")
    print(f"Rating: {episode.rating}")
    print(f"Duration: {episode.duration/60}min")
    print("" + "="*50)
```

####  ⭐⭐New: Company Credits: ⭐⭐ 

* distribution companies, 
* production companies, 
* sales companies, 
* special effects companies, 
* miscellaneous companies

You can now extract information about the companies involved in a movie or series:

```python
from imdbinfo import get_movie

movie = get_movie("tt0133093")  # The Matrix

# Distribution companies
for company in movie.company_credits["distribution"]:
    print(f"Distribution: {company.name} ({company.country})")

# Sales companies
for company in movie.company_credits["sales"]:
    print(f"Sales: {company.name}")

# Production companies
for company in movie.company_credits["production"]:
    print(f"Production: {company.name}")

# Special effects companies
for company in movie.company_credits["specialEffects"]:
    print(f"Special Effects: {company.name}")

# Miscellaneous companies
for company in movie.company_credits["miscellaneous"]:
    print(f"Miscellaneous: {company.name}")
```

#### Alternate titles (AKAs)
Fetch international and alternate titles for any movie or series:
```python
from imdbinfo import get_akas
akas = get_akas("tt0133093")  # The Matrix
for aka in akas["akas"][:5]:
    print(f"{aka.title} ({aka.country_name})")
```
